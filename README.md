## 📖 Overview

Selecting the right antenna requires evaluating multiple RF parameters such as frequency, gain, polarization, radiation pattern, and application type. Finding the best option often requires consulting textbooks, manufacturer datasheets, and technical references.

**Antenna Recommender** simplifies this process by allowing users to enter their project requirements—or simply describe their project in natural language—and receive intelligent antenna recommendations, alternative options, technical comparisons, and AI-generated installation guidance.
